    "## 1. Objective of the assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will choose a real-world dataset related to innovation, R&D, technology, or human capital, and produce descriptive statistics and simple visualizations. You can also (optionally if you feel comfortable with it) run a very simple OLS regression as a first step toward econometric analysis. Most importantly, you're expected to mobilize concepts from your 9-session Economics of innovation course to interpret your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignement is not to do sophisticated econometrics, but to learn how to look at data systematically and connect data patterns to theoretical concepts (R&D, innovation systems, human capital, convergence/divergence, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll write a short, coherent empirical document."

You must choose one main dataset but you are allowed to merge / complement with another (for example, combining a World Bank indicator with WIPO patents).

    "We focus on three major sources of innovation data, which are freely available online and provide indicators that allow to explore innovation-related concepts such as R&D intensity, patenting, human capital, and digital infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with these datasets, start by clearly defining the research question you want to explore. Inspect the data, understand the variables and their definitions through metadata or documentation, and check coverage across years and countries. You can then combine datasets when appropriate, for example merging WIPO patent counts with OECD R&D or World Bank education indicators to study innovation ecosystems. Descriptive statistics, tables, and simple visualizations are useful first steps to explore patterns and relationships before formulating more detailed hypotheses or conducting econometric analysis.\n",

    "#### (a) OECD - Science, Technology and Innovation Data\n",
    "\n",
    "he OECD provides a wide range of innovation-related indicators, including R&D spending, number of researchers, patenting, innovation outputs, business R&D, and more. A good entry point is the OECD Science, Technology and Innovation Scoreboard (STI Scoreboard).\n",

    "#### (b) World Bank\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Bank provides a broad set of country-level indicators relevant to innovation, digital economy, and human capital. Typical indicators include: GERD (% of GDP): R&D expenditure, researchers in R&D (per million inhabitants), high-technology exports (% of manufactured exports), ICT adoption (internet users, mobile subscriptions, etc.), education indicators (tertiary enrollment, years of schooling), etc.\n",
